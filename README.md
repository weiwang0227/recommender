# Overview

The goal of this project is to show how to make a simple article recommendation engine using a semi-recent advance in natural language processing called [word2vec](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf) (or just *word vectors*). In particular, it is going to use a "database" from [Stanford's GloVe project](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) trained on a dump of Wikipedia. The project involves reading in a database of word vectors and a corpus of text articles then organizing them into a handy table (list of lists) for processing.
